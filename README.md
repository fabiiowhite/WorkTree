# WorkTree 🌱
A “work tree” is a self made term to represent different work I’ve worked on, from digital design to programming.    
    
What can you find inside my WorkTree?
- A button that links the website to my Github profile;
- A link that connects the website to my Behance portfolio;
- And one last link that connects the website to my email as a contact measure.
